\begin{document}
\maketitle

You can receive extra credit by creating practice test questions,  one for each chapter covered in detail the course (Chapters  2, 3, \& 4 for Discrete 1, Chapters 5, 9, 11, \& 6 for Discrete 2).

You should: 
\begin{itemize}
\item clearly identify the concept you're testing, 
\item provide the question itself, 
\item then also provide an answer.
\end{itemize}

You will only receive credit if your question is unique (i.e. is not the same as one of your colleagues and not from the book), 
and is non-trivial.
